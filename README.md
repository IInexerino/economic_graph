Of course you need python to run this
You need to have manim and everything needed to run it installed
https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html

to run, open the command prompt, make the folder that the economic_graph.py is in the current directory with the cd command, write:

manim -pql economic_graph.py EconomicGraph

and unless you encounter errors, your animation should assemble and render
